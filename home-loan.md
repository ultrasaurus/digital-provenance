In order to refinance a loan, there is a complex network of actors who review multiple inputs to assess the creditworthiness of the investment.

**Actors**

1) Homeowner- Owns the home and is submitting a request for refinancing.
2) Bank- Organization which owns the loan
3) Loan processor Pete- 3rd party organization working on behalf of bank to assess if house meets code requirements to get loan

**Objects**
1) Loan application
2) House photos- Pete takes photos to validate that the house meet the criteria for the loan
3) Loan evaluation- qualitative commentary and photo evidence

**Flow**
Homeowner-->Loan Application-->Bank--> Loan Processor Pete-->Photos taken by Pete-->Loan application

**How do you know that the content in the photos is authentic?**
Example-- to pass the loan criteria need a carbon monoxide detector but homeowner doesn't have one. But Pete is incented to get the loans approved and finished so he pull a detector out of his pocket, plugs it in and takes a picture. 
Or he photoshops it?
